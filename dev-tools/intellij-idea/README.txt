# Code Style Settings

 #Import Settings
 In Intellij, import the settings in File -> Import Settings -> select sigma_code_style.jar
 This should automatically set the current project to use Sigma code style.
 To check, go to Settings(Preferences on Mac) -> Editor -> Code Style. The Scheme should be set to "Sigma"

 #Format Code
 Select a block of code to format
 Code -> Reformat Code...

 Note: Please do not reformat entire files. This will make the version control system difficult to maintain.
       Only reformat blocks of code you are currently working on.
