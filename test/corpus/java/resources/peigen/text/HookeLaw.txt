Hooke's law is a principle of physics that states that the force F needed to extend or compress a spring by some distance X is proportional to that distance.  Hooke's equation in fact holds (to some extent) in many other situations where an elastic body is deformed, such as wind blowing on a tall building, a musician plucking a string of a guitar, or the filling of a party balloon. An elastic body or material for which this equation can be assumed is said to be linear-elastic or Hookean.  Hooke's law is only a first order linear approximation to the real response of springs and other elastic bodies to applied forces. It must eventually fail once the forces exceed some limit, since no material can be compressed beyond a certain minimum size, or stretched beyond a maximum size, without some permanent deformation or change of state. In fact, many materials will noticeably deviate from Hooke's law well before those elastic limits are reached.
