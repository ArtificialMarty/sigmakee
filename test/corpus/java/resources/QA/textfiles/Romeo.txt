This 140-cm humanoid robot is intended to deepen research on assistance for the elderly and those who have lost autonomy. Its height allows it to open doors, climb stairs, and even grab objects on a table. Started in January 2009, the ROMEO Project has four main complementary goals. They cover several major aspects in the development of robotics in France - A mechatronic platform and interactive, open, and scalable software, Robot Staff Assistant, surveillance and HMI functions, A robust platform for research and a Platform for a commercial robotics cluster.
