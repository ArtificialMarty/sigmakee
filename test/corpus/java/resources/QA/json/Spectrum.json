    "question" : "Which color can be made only by a mix of multiple wavelengths?",
    "answer" : "From what I understand, the answer should be unsaturated colors such as pink, or purple variations such as magenta, are absent, for example, because the colors can be made only by a mix of multiple wavelengths."

    "answer" : "From what I understand, the answer should be because it overlaps the human visible response spectrum."
