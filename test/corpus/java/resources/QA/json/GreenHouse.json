    "question" : "What leads to the greenhouse effect?",
    "answer" : "Likely, human activity since the Industrial Revolution has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to increased radiative forcing from CO2, methane, tropospheric ozone, CFCs and nitrous oxide."

    "answer" : "Most likely the answer is the greenhouse effect was proposed by Joseph Fourier in 1824, discovered in 1860 by John Tyndall, was first investigated quantitatively by Svante Arrhenius in 1896, and was developed in the 1930 s through 1960 s by Guy Stewart Callendar."
