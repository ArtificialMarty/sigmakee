    "question" : "How did Graham’s research on diffusion of gases get triggered?",
    "answer" : "Most likely, Graham's research on the diffusion of gases was triggered by his reading about the observation of German chemist Johann Döbereiner that hydrogen gas diffused out of a small crack in a glass bottle faster than the surrounding air diffused in to replace hydrogen gas."

    "question" : "How did Graham measure the rate of diffusion of gases?",
    "answer" : "Perhaps, Graham measured the rate of diffusion of gases through plaster plugs, through very fine tubes, and through small orifices."

    "answer" : "Italian physicist Amedeo Avogadro had suggested in 1811 that equal volumes of different gases contain equal numbers of molecules."

    "question" : "What is the Kinetic theory of gases ?",
    "answer" : "I'm pretty sure the answer is perhaps the greatest success of the kinetic theory of gases, as insight came to be called, was the discovery that for gases, the temperature as measured on the Kelvin-LRB-absolute-RRB-temperature scale is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the gas molecules."

    "question" : "Who explained the properties of gases as collections of small particles moving through largely empty space?",
    "answer" : "I'm pretty sure the answer is Avogadro's insight together with other studies of gas behaviour provided a basis for later theoretical work by Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell to explain the properties of gases as collections of small particles moving through largely empty space."

    "question" : "How does molecules have equal kinetic energies?",
    "answer" : "Probably, thus, to have equal kinetic energies, the velocities of two different molecules would have to be in inverse proportion to the square roots of their masses."
  },
  {
    "file": "GrahamResearch.txt",
    "question" : "How is the rate of effusion determined?",
    "answer" : "Likely, the rate of effusion is determined by the number of molecules entering an aperture per unit time, and hence by the average molecular velocity."

    "answer" : "Smaranika, I'm pretty sure the answer is Graham's law for diffusion could thus be understood as a consequence of the molecular kinetic energies being equal at the same temperature."
