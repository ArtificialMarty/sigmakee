    "question" : "What is Hubble’s law ?",
    "answer" : "Hubble's law is the name for the observation in physical cosmology that: objects observed in deep space (extragalactic space, ~ 10 megaparsecs or more) are found to have a Doppler shift interpretable as relative velocity away from the Earth;."
